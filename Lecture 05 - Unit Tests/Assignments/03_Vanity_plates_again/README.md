# Re-requesting a Vanity Plate

Resume the [`plates.py`](../../../Lecture%2002%20-%20Loops/Assignments/04_vanity_plates/plates.py) file from the [Vanity Plates assignment](../../../Lecture%2002%20-%20Loops/Assignments/04_vanity_plates/README.md). 

Then, in a file called `test_plates.py`, implement four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of `is_valid` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you can execute your tests with:
```shell
pytest test_plates.py
```
