# In Python there is a library called "re" which is used
# to work with Regular Expressions.
# A RE is a pattern, ad this library is used to check if
# a string contains the specified search pattern,
# to validate inputs, to replace parts of a string, to
# split a string into substrings, etc.
#
# One of the most important module in the re library is
# the re.search(pattern, string, flags=0) function,
# which takes a regular expression pattern and a string
# and searches for that pattern within the string.
#
# A pattern can contain special characters:
#   . any character except a newline
#   * 0 or more repetitions
#   + 1 or more repetitions
#   ? 0 or 1 repetition -> optional
#   {m} m repetitions
#   {m,n} range mâ€“n repetitions
#   ^ matches the start of the string
#   $ matches the end of the string or just before the
#     newline at the end of the string
#   [] set of specific characters allowed
#   [^] complementing the set, i.e., elements that must not be in the pattern
#   \d decimal digit
#   \D not a decimal digit
#   \s whitespace characters
#   \S not a whitespace character
#   \w word character... as well as numbers and the underscore
#   \W not a word character
#   A|B either A or B
#   (...) a group
#   (?:...) non-capturing version

#   - re.match(pattern, string, flags=0) -> match only at the beginning of the string,

#   - re.fullmatch(pattern, string, flags=0) -> match the whole string, i.e., without
#     specifying the ^ at the beginning and the $ at the end of the pattern
