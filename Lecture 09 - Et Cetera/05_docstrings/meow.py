# A standard way of commenting your functionâ€™s purpose is to use a docstring. 


# Differently from what I've done in the previous snippets, the docstring is
# meant to go inside the function, not outside it.
# There are a lot of tools that can read the docstrings written in a restructured
# text format and generate documentation for you. For example, Sphinx can generate
# HTML documentation
