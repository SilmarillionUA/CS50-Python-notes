# It turns ou that Python does require the explicit declaration of types.
# Nevertheless, itâ€™s good practice need to ensure all of your variables 
# are of the right type.
# `mypy` is a program that can help you test to make sure all your variables
# are of the right type.
# You can install `mypy` by executing in your terminal window: 
#   `pip install mypy`
#
# Python accepts type hints, which are a way to tell the interpreter what
# type a variable is. This is not required, but it is good practice.
# Type hints are not enforced by the interpreter, but they can be checked
# by mypy.
